Your Game
==============

This repository contains a game I made for my wife's 32nd birthday. I placed an icon on her iPhone and surprised her with an epic scavenger hunt. The application was essentially her tour guide for the day...with some help from her friends. The phyiscal clues are no longer active so don't think you can recreate the experience.
